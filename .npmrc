# Prevent automatic breaking upgrades
# See: https://github.com/B0yZ4kr14/tsijukebox/issues/28

# Use tilde (~) prefix instead of caret (^) to limit updates to patch versions
save-prefix=~

# Require explicit npm install for security fixes at moderate level or higher
audit-level=moderate

# Safe upgrade process:
# 1. Check what's outdated (READ ONLY): npm outdated
# 2. Upgrade patch versions (safe): npm update
# 3. For MAJOR versions, do manually: npm install package@X.Y.Z --save
#    (replace X.Y.Z with the specific stable version you want)
# 4. Test before committing: npm run build && npm run test
# 5. Only then commit: git add package.json package-lock.json
#
# WARNING: DO NOT use `npm audit fix --force` - it may cause major version upgrades
# that break the build. Use `npm audit` (read-only) instead to review vulnerabilities.
